   ## Installation
   When the application is run, the user is prompted to provide details for the team manager. After, they are asked to either create an intern, engineer or their team is finished. The user can create as many team memebers as they like. After each team memeber is created, the user is again asked if they'd like to create a new member or to exit the application. When they exit, a html file with built in css is created and each team member is displayed on the web-page. The user input is collected and sorted in classes exported to index.js. An array with their data is used to get each member. Test.js is used for each class to ensure the input matches expected. the inquirer node package is used to generate prompts and the jest package is used to run the tests.
